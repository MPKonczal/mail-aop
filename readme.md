Homework from the sixth week of the Spring Boot 2 course.

The application uses aspect-oriented programming (AOP). Everyone 
who refers to the GET method will receive a list of movies (name, 
year, producer). The POST method allows you to add a movie to the 
list and then sends an email using the aspect.
